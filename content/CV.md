I am a chemist with experience and expertise in physical and theoretical chemistry. My research domains focus much on materials, particularly atomic clusters, 2D materials, biological materials,  polymers, and catalysts. I graduated (Ph.D.) from  Department of Chemistry, University of Leuven, Belgium (September 2019). After PhD graduation, I joined the Russo Group (Department of Physics, RMIT,  Australia) as a visiting scholar for short time, and then actively worked in the group of Prof. Tiffany Walsh (Institute for Frontier Materials, Deakin University) as a postdoctoral research fellow. In July 2022, I joined the group of Prof. Michelle Coote (Flinders University) to continue my research ambition. I had been also a yearly-contract lecturer at Department of Chemistry, University of Dalat, Vietnam for 10 years.
