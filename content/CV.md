I am a chemist (materials researcher) with  experience and expertise in physical and theoretical chemistry. My  research focuses much on advanced materials, particularly atomic  clusters, 2D materials, biological materials, polymers, and catalysts. I graduated (Ph.D.) from Department of Chemistry, University of Leuven,  Belgium (September 2019). After PhD graduation, I joined Department of  Physics, RMIT, Australia as a visiting scholar for short time, and then  actively worked in Institute for Frontier Materials, Deakin University  as a postdoctoral research fellow. In July 2022, I joined Flinders  University to continue my research ambition. I had been also a  yearly-contract lecturer at Department of Chemistry, University of  Dalat, Vietnam (2010-2020).
