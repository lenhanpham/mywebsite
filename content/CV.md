I am a chemist whose research experience is related to physical & theoretical chemistry and materials, particularly atomic clusters, excited states, and currently 2D&biological materials. I graduated (Ph.D.) from  Department of Chemistry, University of Leuven, Belgium (September 2019), and is currently working as a postdoctoral research fellow at Deakin University and visiting scholar at Department of Physics, RMIT,  Australia. I was also a yearly-contract lecturer at Department of Chemistry, University of Dalat, Vietnam.
