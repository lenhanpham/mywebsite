##### 1. A simple Hartree-Fock program written in Python 3

In an attempt to learn programming, I have created a small program written in Python 3, which can solve the Schrodinger equation for HHe+ at the Hartree-Fock level. If you are interested in Python programming and basic quantum chemical theory, just have a look at it (on [Github](https://github.com/lenhanpham/Hartree-Fock "Hartree-Fock")). In the future, this program will be improved and updated.

##### 2. Small quantum chemical program written in C++ 

This program is under development, and will be available on Github very soon.
